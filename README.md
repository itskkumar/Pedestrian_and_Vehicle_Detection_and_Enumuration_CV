# Pedestrian Detection & Enumeration using YOLOv8n + DeepSORT

A real-time, lane-aware pedestrian tracking system that leverages state-of-the-art computer vision (CV) and deep learning models for smart urban monitoring. Built with **YOLOv8n**, **DeepSORT**, and an intuitive **Gradio** interface, this project enables accurate pedestrian detection, multi-object tracking, and dynamic lane-based analyticsâ€”all deployable on **Hugging Face Spaces**.
